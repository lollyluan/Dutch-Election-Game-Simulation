## Question And Strategies

## After Elicitation (Outputs And Follow-up Actions)
### Follow-up actions

1. Organize the notes of the interview.
2. Discuss the requirements in the group, determine the scope and identify the roles, form a general framework of this project and decide where to dig deeper.
3. Transform the requirements into specific scenarios or user stories to form a better understanding of the system and serve as a measure to verify the needs of the client.
4. Identify the challenges and elements which can cause failure in this project and start to seek a possible solution.
5. Prepare questions for those requirements that still remain unclear.
