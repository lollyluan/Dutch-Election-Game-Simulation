# Motivational Model

## Overview
The motivational model for the "Terror in Tilburg" project is designed to outline the key drivers and incentives behind the development of the software. This model captures the goals, needs, and desires of the primary stakeholders.

The model highlights how the interactive and engaging nature of the game will motivate students to actively participate in the learning process, enhancing their understanding of complex geopolitical scenarios and fostering critical thinking. It also emphasizes the tutorâ€™s role in using the software as a tool to make lessons more dynamic and effective.
