# Dutch-Election-Game-Simulation

## Project Background

"Terror in Tilberg" is a Matrix Game designed by Tim Price, simulating potential terrorist activities leading up to the 2017 Dutch elections. Set in the Netherlands, the game involves key actors such as the Hofstad Network terrorist group, the far-right New Thule movement, Party for Freedom leader Geert Wilders, and Russia. Over six turns, players make decisions and take actions to influence the outcome, ultimately determining whether the current political establishment or a radical right shift prevails in the election and government formation.
